Business Outcome
Efficient utilisation of bond inventory on the books and maximize balance sheet usage
Enable trading of long dated repos and minimize cost of funding across all Asia markets
Asia local markets treasury would also benefit and could contribute to the platform evolution
APEX Asia build will follow global product and platform strategy
Cost Saves: $ X
Revenue Opportunities: $ Y
Technology Outcome
Long term Repo trading is enabled via APEX/BTM/EBAR infrastructure in phased manner
Bloomberg Repo booking would continue with APEX FTB infra and Bloomberg usage would be phased out
Asia specific NFRR/FR integration required with introduction of APEX as new platform in new entities
Local technology and external Regulatory approval routines need to be factored in the planning process
APEX Risk infrastructure would be owned by MACRO Risk Team
Technology Outcomes Not in Scope
Exceptions: Indonesia Repo trading continues to be managed via Indonesia Bank in a Box given on-shoring requirements
Exception: APEX for Branches which don't have BTM/EBAR and have GBS NIS dependencies. No effort would be undertaken to link APEX to legacy black-office platforms like GBS
Repo E-trading capabilities - Lift to the existing GFF offering need to be considered and should be addressed as part of P2/GRET/RAPTOR infrastructure

Investment Proposals and Product Roadmap
Products/Pally - Repo Platform investment proposal phases
Products/Trading - POC Identifications across entities
Entities/Desks/Countries in Scope
Singapore POC (Has right back-office aligned)
Malaysia POC (Covers BTM/EBAR front to back simplification initiative)
Internal MLI/BANA vs Branches Repos
Resourcing Plan
Pally - Identify opportunities to self fund within FMTA; redeploy from functional areas where platform maturity on BAU/INIT has been achieved. Small carve out from LCT BE basket could be utilized to drive pilot POC entity transition
Rob/Prabhat/Pally - FMTA augmentation with GBS resources to build support team from Asia (New Grads or experienced team within GBS)
Products/Rob/Murugan/Pally - Ops simplification/SOR Simplification/BE sleeves to be pursued to have BTM/EBAR deployed across the region
Rob/Issac/Pally/Prabhat - Training plan for identified resources
